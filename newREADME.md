>changes in this updated version of the component 
1. structure of the module is changed, "model" module which was inside model "engine" is now parallel to it. 
2. I was getting error while running tests "module engine not found ", so I moved it in the root folder.
3. I created a new module "Battery " for the given battery types and clean the "model" module 
4. I found an error in the "module. Palindrome " , it is given that it uses "spindler battery" but I found the condition "nubbin battery" is written 
    so I correct it and also changed the test case
